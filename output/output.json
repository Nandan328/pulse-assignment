      "summary": "",
      "pros": "Working with multiple clients and internal projects means conversations can easily get messy, but Slack keeps everything where it should be. Channels help me separate campaigns, and quick voice notes or huddles make decisions faster than long emails. I also like how well it integrates with tools we already use—it saves time when sharing docs or automating small tasks.",
      "cons": "The only friction is when channels multiply too quickly; without discipline, notifications can feel overwhelming and require occasional cleanup."

File retention policies and file sharing is also easy to manage, and is one of the more secure means",

Instead of setting up each Slack with a different specific user per computer, we use one email to set it up by \"region\" of computers since our computers are not specifically tied to one person but rather to a group of people. For example, our receptionists all share the same log in so when I want to reach out the receptionist group, I just use one chat line regardless of which of my receptionists happen to be available."

Slack was honestly very nice to use, we all had different roles within the company and had channels created for each role. Everyone could see what we were each working on and it would keep a record of what we have completed. We had a mutual channel that we used for discussion and we also had private channels where we would discuss personal things with the supervisors. I liked that we could upload videos and pictures and react to certain discussions by emoji's. My favorite was to mark a task as completed with the green checkmark. We could always go back and look at the channels and find out if a specific task was completed. I only contacted Costumer support once and they were extremely helpful and friendly.",
